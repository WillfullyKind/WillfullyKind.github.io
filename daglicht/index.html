            <h3>The Joe BROgan Experience</h3>
            <p>Listen here Joe Rogan, we need to talk to you. <br>
            We are going through ridiculous efforts to speak to the king of podcasts. <br>
            Following in his footsteps while discovering many aspects of Mr.Rogan's life, <br>
            we want to reach him by making online noise. <br>
            Listen and help us on our road to Rogan.

            <h3>Breathe Motherfucker</h3>
            <p>It broke our hearts seeing people wither away behind screens. <br> 
                We want to be remembered on how it feels to be human. <br>
                A thing everybody keeps telling us is pay attention to the breath. <br>
                From meditation to Icebaths, breathing seems to be the number one priority. <br>
                We are going to explore our bodies and mind through challenging experiences. <br>
                Join us from the comfort of where ever you are.

            <h3>The Dopecast</h3>
            <p>2021 and still there is a huge taboo to be broken about drugs. <br> 
                Open conversations about psychedelics is needed.<br>
                Follow us on our journey to learn the science behind spacing out.  <br>
                From Cafeine to LSD, we want to know what brains do while stimulated by substances. <br>
                Are there any positive uses of drugs we might be missing out on? <br>

            <p> As an amateur buddhist, Joren tries explaining basic concepts of this philosophy,<br> 
                to an unexperienced but curious guest.<br>
                There is light and love to be given, by getting to know ourselves. <br>
                together we think and explore secular buddhism. <br>
                A modern take on an ancient philosophy. <br>
